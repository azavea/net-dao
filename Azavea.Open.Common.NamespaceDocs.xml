			<summary>
				This assembly holds utility or helper classes that are very generic, but too small or
				too standalone to deserve their own assembly.  It is intended primarily to support other
				applications rather than to be its own standalone project.

		<member name="N:Azavea.Open.Common.Caching">
			<summary>
				Classes for caching objects.  Substantial performance improvements can sometimes be
				gained by reusing objects rather than creating new ones and letting others be garbage
				collected, if you are dealing in large numbers of objects.

		<member name="N:Azavea.Open.Common.Collections">
			<summary>
				Handy collection classes.  Originally created so that you could use collections (or
				helper methods for accessing collections) that throw meaningful exceptions, like rather
				than "out of range" saying "45 is outside this list, which has only 23 elements" or
				"the key 'foo' is not in this dictionary".
