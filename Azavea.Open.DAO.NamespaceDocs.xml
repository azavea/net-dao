			<summary>
				Maps .NET objects to data sources (databases, files, REST APIs, etc). 
				Similar to NHibernate, but with a different philosophy. Designed to be 
				simple enough for anyone to use and fast enough for extremely high 
				throughput on very large data sets. 
			</summary>
		</member>
		<member name="N:Azavea.Open.DAO.Criteria">
			<summary>
				All of the expressions that go into specifying what data you want back
				and in what order.
			</summary>
		</member>
		<member name="N:Azavea.Open.DAO.Criteria.Grouping">
			<summary>
				If you wish to aggregate your data ("GROUP BY" in SQL), you'll use these
				classes to specify that.
			</summary>
		</member>
		<member name="N:Azavea.Open.DAO.Criteria.Joins">
			<summary>
				To join two data sources (can be tables in an RDBMS, can be totally
				unrelated sources such as a database table and a CSV), use these classes
				to specify how.
			</summary>
		</member>
		<member name="N:Azavea.Open.DAO.Criteria.Spatial">
			<summary>
				Spatial expressions for defining queries against spatial data sources
				live here.
			</summary>
		</member>
		<member name="N:Azavea.Open.DAO.Exceptions">
			<summary>
				Here you'll find the various exceptions that FastDAO can throw.
			</summary>

		<member name="N:Azavea.Open.DAO.Memory">
			<summary>
				This is a memory-based data source for FastDAO.  It supports most of
				the features that any real data source supports, but stores the data
				in memory.  It is not designed to be super-fast, it is intended primarily
				for allowing unit testing of FastDAO without requiring any "real" data
				source to be present.
			</summary>
		</member>
		<member name="N:Azavea.Open.DAO.SQL">
			<summary>
				There are a number of abstract classes and helpers that live here, to
				allow common code to be shared between all the SQL-based data sources.
			</summary>
		</member>
		<member name="N:Azavea.Open.DAO.Unqueryable">
			<summary>
				Some data sources (such as CSV files) are not naturally queryable, so
				all the data must be read every time we query, and only matching records
				kept.  This assembly contains helper classes for doing that.
			</summary>
		</member>
		<member name="N:Azavea.Open.DAO.Util">
			<summary>
				Utility classes used by FastDAO for caching, things that apply to all
				data sources, and other misc utility classes live here.
